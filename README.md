# Ecommerce Web Application with Django

First Django Application after learning Python ðŸ˜ƒ. I am really enjoying Python and Django. Everything is same like Node.js except syntax difference and battery included in Django. It was faster than expressjs. Loved it.

**Features implemented till now**:

- Both Django Admin and Rest Framework at the same time from login and browsable api to Django Admin section
- Working Authenticated Product and Category Models
- Readonly products and categories
- Postgresql

I saw a library called [Graphene-Django](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) which is capable of adding graphql in django. Right now, I used Rest API architechture. So, Ignored it for now.

### Prequesties

- Used `pipenv` instead of `pip` package manager. `pipenv` felt more like Node.js `package.json`, so went for it. also, I could see how many packages/modules I installed and run custom scripts with `[scripts]` section. So, definitely recommend it.
- There are some default libraries need to be installed for django like "Pellow"
